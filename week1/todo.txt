Make sure the ssh server is running AND check that it is installed with:
`sudo apt list --installed | grep openssh-server`
Check if running:
`sudo service ssh status`
If you get an error or some response like: 
` * sshd is not running`
Run the service:
` sudo service ssh start`

If you get the error like here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68077905/getting-error-permission-denied-publickey-password-after-start-dfs-sh:

# ssh-keygen -t rsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
